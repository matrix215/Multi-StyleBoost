# multi-boost

This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper "Multi-StyleBoost"
![5 69509754](https://github.com/matrix215/Multi-StyleBoost/assets/101815603/ebae3e68-604d-409c-9546-bf93710601ae) ![0 79038736](https://github.com/matrix215/Multi-StyleBoost/assets/101815603/1107c543-f1f1-41aa-8b0f-a37e4fd8d109)




this is the Multi-StyleBoost code.

this is different from Custom-Dffusion and Dreambooth.

this is a method that trains 2 concepts using Dreambooth method at the same time.

Unlike Custom-Diffusion, the effect of this method indicates that style is optimized for learning.
